# hplib - heat pump library

Content from repository with code to simulate heat pump efficiency (COP) as well as electrical (P_el) & thermal power (P_th) and massflow (m_dot) as time series. For the simulation, it is possible to calculate outputs of a specific manufacturer + model or alternatively for one of 6 different generic heat pump types.
